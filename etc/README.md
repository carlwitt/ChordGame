# Chord Game

Practical exercise around the piano and music theory.

## Basic principle
To get more familiar with the keyboard, the application displays random triads for the user to recognize. 
The answer is input by selecting a key and an inversion.

## Design
This exercise hopefully also helps to internalize the circle of fifths, since the solution options are arranged in this way.
To locate a solution, the user can either scan through them or recall the accidentals (e.g., 4 b for f minor).
The idea is that either way, the association between keys and their accidentals is memorized.
